\item{importance}{Logical indicating whether to perform feature importance selection.}

\item{type}{The type of logistic regression. Currently only supports "class" for classification.}

\item{nfolds}{The number of folds for cross-validation.}

\item{ignoreWarnings}{Logical indicating whether to ignore warnings.}

\item{k}{The number of important features to select.}
}
